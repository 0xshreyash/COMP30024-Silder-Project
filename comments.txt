Creative points completed:
-> Our Agent class does all the updating and initializing for us, so that we can make as many classes of agents as we want in order to try different strategies without having to do extra work. This is being creative with the design in order to be able to allow our creativity in terms of implementing different algorithms to shine without having to do the tedious work again and again.

Not completed:
